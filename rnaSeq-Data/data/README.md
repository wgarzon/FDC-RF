**Data set Description:**

The information corresponds to gene expression cancer RNA-Seq Data.  The RNA-seq (RNA sequencing) data analyzed is part of the PANCAN project ([Link](https://dcc.icgc.org/pcawg#:~:text=The%20Pan-Cancer%20Analysis%20of,the%20International%20Cancer%20Genome%20Consortium.)).  The three versions of files differ on the number of samples and genes contained in each one.
- **uciPanCan.csv:** data set extracted from the UCI ML repository with 801 patient samples for 20,531 genes. [Source](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/gene+expression+cancer+RNA-Seq). [Download](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1uhYnZ5VDb3N0EVRE7zQtJXuHtnWqUmf6/view?usp=sharing)
- **allDataPanCan.csv:** The data set corresponds to original samples of the PANCAN project for five types of cancer: (BRCA), renal kidney (KIRC), colon (COAD), lung (LUAD), and prostate (PRAD).
